# 🐍 Beginner Project: Number Guessing Game
# 🎯 Goal:
# Let the user guess a number between 1 and 100. The program gives hints if the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

# what we need:
    
#     1: Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
#    2: Ask the user to guess the number.
#    3: Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

user_input = input("Guess a number between 0 and 100")
print(user_input)
